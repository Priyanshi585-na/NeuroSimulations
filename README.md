# 🧠 NeuroSimulations: Modeling Neuronal Activity
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how different computational models simulate neuronal dynamics.

---

## 📘 1. PharmaNeuroSim — Hodgkin–Huxley Model + Drug Effects
This notebook explores how various pharmacological agents influence neuron membrane potential and firing behavior using the **Hodgkin–Huxley model**.

### 🔬 Features
- Simulates Na⁺, K⁺, and leak channel dynamics  
- Models drug-induced changes in conductance or time constants  
- Plots membrane potential vs. time for each condition  



## ⚙️ 2. LIFNeuronNetwork — Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model
A lightweight simulation of a simple neuron network using the **LIF model**, ideal for understanding basic spiking dynamics.

### 🔬 Features
- Adjustable threshold and reset potential  
- Variable input current  
- Visualizes firing rate and spike train  


## ⚙️ Requirements
Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
